# Network Funtime Company - Process Review

After evaluating Network Funtime Company’s current IT infrastructure, several key improvements could significantly enhance both efficiency and security, especially considering the company’s limited resources.

## 1. Standardizing Laptop Hardware
Currently, the HR team buys the cheapest available laptops, resulting in a diverse and mismatched fleet of devices. This approach complicates IT support, from troubleshooting to software deployment. Standardizing a few laptop models that fit the company’s needs and budget would streamline maintenance, software updates, and driver management. Additionally, bulk purchasing a small inventory of laptops in advance would eliminate delays when new employees start.

## 2. Asset Inventory and Labeling
The company lacks a formal inventory system, making it difficult to track laptops or audit company assets. Implementing a simple inventory management system—whether a spreadsheet or a dedicated tool—and labeling each device would provide better accountability and make it easier to locate lost or stolen equipment.

## 3. Centralizing New Hire Setup
New hires currently receive hardware without pre-installed software, and the HR person spends a significant amount of time setting them up. By creating standardized images for both Windows and Linux laptops, including necessary software and configurations, the setup process would be faster and more consistent. IT staff should handle the setup rather than HR to improve efficiency and reduce onboarding time.

## 4. Password and Login Management
The lack of a strict password policy or self-service password recovery options often leads to employees needing to reimage their machines when they forget their login credentials. Implementing stronger password policies and enabling self-service password resets for cloud-based services would reduce downtime and reliance on IT staff.

## 5. Streamlining Communication for IT Requests
Currently, all IT-related requests go through HR’s email, which causes delays and burdens HR unnecessarily. Implementing a dedicated IT helpdesk or ticketing system would direct issues to the appropriate team, improving response times and tracking.

Overall, these improvements focus on reducing downtime, increasing security, and freeing up HR from IT responsibilities. By making these changes, the company can enhance the employee experience, improve operational efficiency, and create a more secure and manageable IT environment.
