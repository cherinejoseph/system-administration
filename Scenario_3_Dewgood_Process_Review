# Process Review for Dewgood

After reviewing Dewgood’s current IT infrastructure, there are a few important areas where improvements could really help make things run smoother and more secure for the company’s 50 employees.

### 1. **Streamline Computer Procurement**  
Right now, buying computers on the day a new employee starts causes delays and puts extra pressure on you. I recommend setting up a small inventory of standard-configured laptops or desktops, even if it’s just a few, so new hires can get up and running immediately. You could also consider purchasing through a vendor that offers quick delivery and volume discounts to stretch the limited budget.

### 2. **Improve Active Directory User Management**  
Currently, when employees leave, their accounts aren’t disabled. This poses a security risk because former employees may retain access to sensitive data. Implementing a formal offboarding process that disables or removes user accounts promptly will help protect company resources.

### 3. **Enhance the Ticketing System or Train Staff**  
The open-source ticketing system is confusing, so people avoid it and go directly to you, creating bottlenecks. Either switching to a more user-friendly ticketing system or providing training to employees on how to use the current one would help ensure requests are tracked and resolved efficiently without overwhelming you.

### 4. **Increase Website Reliability and Monitoring**  
The company website going down frequently is a problem, especially since no one knows how to fix it. Moving the website to a more reliable hosting service, such as a basic cloud platform, would improve uptime. Also, setting up simple monitoring tools with alerts can notify you immediately when the site goes down so it can be addressed quickly.

### 5. **Standardize Software Installation and Orientation**  
Installing software and performing orientations for each new hire can be time-consuming. Creating a standardized setup image with all necessary software pre-installed can speed up provisioning. Additionally, preparing a clear orientation checklist or guide can help reduce repetitive questions and empower employees to resolve common issues on their own.

### Conclusion  
These process improvements balance Dewgood’s budget constraints with practical steps to increase security, reduce downtime, and make IT support more efficient—letting you focus on bigger projects instead of constant firefighting.
