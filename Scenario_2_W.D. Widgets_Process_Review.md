# W.D. Widgets - Process Review

After assessing W.D. Widgets’ current IT infrastructure, several key improvements could significantly enhance efficiency, data security, and scalability as the company continues to grow rapidly.

## 1. Automating Software Deployment
Currently, installing sales-specific applications on every new machine is done manually and takes several hours. Implementing an automated software deployment solution, such as Active Directory Group Policy or a dedicated software management tool, would save time, reduce errors, and streamline onboarding for new employees.

## 2. Implementing Data Backup and Recovery
Customer data is stored on a single file server without any backup, which presents a significant risk of data loss. Setting up a reliable backup system—whether on-site, off-site, or a hybrid solution—would protect against data loss from accidental deletions, hardware failure, or cyber incidents. Regularly testing backups is critical to ensure business continuity in the event of a disaster.

## 3. Introducing Role-Based Access Controls
Currently, whoever creates a folder owns it and controls access, which can lead to inconsistent permissions and accidental data loss. Establishing role-based access controls (RBAC) and shared ownership policies would ensure that sensitive data is accessible only to authorized personnel and would help protect against mistakes or unauthorized access.

## 4. Scaling Hardware Procurement and Inventory
With rapid growth on the horizon, maintaining only one or two machines in stock is inadequate. Creating a larger inventory of pre-configured machines will help you respond quickly to new hires. Furthermore, establishing vendor partnerships or exploring hardware leasing options will provide greater flexibility and faster delivery of equipment.

## 5. Planning for Cloud Migration or Hybrid Services
Currently, W.D. Widgets manages all services in-house, including email, messaging, and file storage, placing a heavy burden on infrastructure and resources. Evaluating cloud or hybrid service options could enhance scalability, reduce maintenance overhead, improve uptime, and provide better security features.

## 6. Setting Up a Formal IT Helpdesk System
Having users email you directly for IT-related issues can lead to missed requests or delayed responses. Implementing a ticketing or helpdesk system would help organize and prioritize IT requests, track issues more efficiently, and improve communication transparency across the company.

These improvements will help W.D. Widgets scale its IT infrastructure efficiently, secure critical customer data, and reduce the workload on IT staff, ultimately allowing the company to handle growth while maintaining a high level of service and security.
