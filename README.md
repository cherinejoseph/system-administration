## **Scenarios**

### **1. Network Funtime Company - Systems Administration Review**

**Scenario Overview:**  
Network Funtime Company is a small company that builds open-source software. As the new system administrator, you are tasked with evaluating their current IT infrastructure and recommending improvements.

### **2. W.D. Widgets - Systems Administration Review**

**Scenario Overview:**  
W.D. Widgets is a sales company with 80-100 employees. The company’s IT systems are managed by a single system administrator, and they currently rely on Windows Active Directory for machine management. New machines are provisioned manually, and sales-specific applications are installed individually on each computer. There is no cloud infrastructure, and customer data is stored on a single file server, which lacks any backup system or fail-safes.

The company’s growth is rapidly accelerating, and they need improvements in scalability, data security, and IT management processes to ensure smooth operations moving forward.

### **3. Dewgood - Systems Administration Review**

**Scenario Overview:**  
Dewgood is a small non-profit organization with 50 employees. The IT infrastructure is managed by a single administrator. There are several challenges, including slow provisioning of hardware (as computers are only purchased when an employee is hired), lack of centralized management, and an outdated ticketing system. Employee accounts are not disabled when they leave, and there is no formal procedure for managing the website, which frequently experiences downtime.

The company relies on a single server for file and email services, and the backup process is manual and prone to potential data loss. Dewgood needs improvements to their IT processes to enhance operational efficiency, security, and overall system reliability.
